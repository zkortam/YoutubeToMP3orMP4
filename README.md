## Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up the project locally for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

All you need is a modern web browser. No additional dependencies are required.

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
   ```

2. **Navigate into the project directory:**

   ```bash
   cd your-repo-name
   ```

3. **Open `index.html` in your browser:**

   You can open the file directly in your browser, or if you have a local development server, run it to serve the file.

   For example, using Pythonâ€™s HTTP server:

   ```bash
   # For Python 3.x
   python -m http.server 8000
   ```

   Then, navigate to `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.

## Usage

1. **Enter a YouTube link:** Paste the YouTube URL into the input field.
2. **Select a format:** Choose either MP3 or MP4 using the radio buttons.
3. **Select quality:** Based on the chosen format, select the desired quality option.
4. **Convert & Download:** Click the "Convert & Download" button. (In this demo, the selections will be shown via an alert. In a real-world application, this would trigger the conversion process on your backend.)

## Customization

- **Backend Integration:**  
  Replace the alert in the JavaScript code with an API call to your backend service that handles the conversion and download.
  
- **Styling:**  
  The CSS is written within the `<style>` tag. Feel free to modify the styles or move them to an external stylesheet as needed.

- **Adding Features:**  
  You can expand the functionality by integrating error handling, input validation, and conversion progress feedback.
